# ETC5523 Assessment 1

This is a shiny app for the ETC5523 Assessment 1. 

* The creator of this shiny app is **Xianghe Xu**.
* The data used for this assessment is the [coffee chains](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2018/2018-05-07) data from github. 

The goal of the app is to use some spatial techniques to map the locations of coffeehouses onto country maps and makes it easier for the potential users to visualize the location distribution of the coffeehouses, and also builds a connection between the potential user and the coffee chain data directly from the shiny app, in other words that the users can access the chain data set without any coding knowledge. The last part of app enables the users to compare the total number of coffeehouses between countries.
